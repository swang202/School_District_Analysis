Analysis was conducted using python (pandas). Tables was presented for each of the following metrics:

- The district summary and school summary
- The top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on - the overall passing rate
- The average math and reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on budge per student, school size, and school type

## Results:
#### The top five schools with the **worst** performaces are five *Charter* schools:

- Cabrera High School
